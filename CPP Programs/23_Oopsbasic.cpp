    // C++ --> initially called --> C with classes by stroustroup
    // class --> extension of structures (in C)
    // structures had limitations
    //      - members are public
    //      - No methods
    // classes --> structures + more
    // classes --> can have methods and properties
    // classes --> can make few members as private & few as public
    // structures in C++ are typedefed
    // you can declare objects along with the class declarion like this:
    /* class Employee{
            // Class definition
        } harry, rohan, lovish; 
    */
    // harry.salary = 8 makes no sense if salary is private

    // Nesting of member functions
